# LinearEquations
A program to solve linear equations written in Lisp.
The function ```Lisp (LinearEquation) ``` is the main function which uses other functions to solve any given linear equation string
An example of the program input string:
```Lisp
(LinearEquation '(3 Y + 12 Y - 6 = 9))
```
The output should be:
```Lisp
Y = 1
```
